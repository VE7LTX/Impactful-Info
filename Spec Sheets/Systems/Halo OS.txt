Hi Matt,

See Halo Controller setup manual attached!   This is for IP address and initial login as well as for customer terminal and group activation/configuration and management.

Hytera does the initial installation of POC software, NMS software and license file.  We will usually also add the customer IP address as a lot of folks seem to get it wrong and itâ€™s a pain to reset afterwards.

From that point the dealers would take over and program terminals based on customer requirements.

Follow the attached manual and login to NMS to create the groups and terminals they wish to have active.

Subcriber management is where you create end user terminals and group management for groups.   

You can make a radio a member of a group, or add multiple groups to a radio.   You can also add multiple radios to multiple groups at same time.

FOACSU = radio plays audio right away
OACSU = radio rings and needs to be answered prior to joining call

Just some info to keep you busy, lol.
